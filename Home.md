The use of graph view is highly discouraged. It is a mess. . . *for now*. 

The use of light mode is also discouraged as all diagrams are produced as white-on-transparent. 

***Disabling the CSS snippets is highly discouraged as they are required to view the content in an orderly manner.***

## To-Do: ##
- [ ] Entirely remake the computer science canvas, it is a mess, doesn't follow the curriculum, is separated into ambiguous and loose groups and completely disregards the specification
- [ ] convert image equations  to $\LaTeX$ typesetting (also stop using html, its insecure and long-winded)
- [x] improve spacing and readability
- [x] improve folder structure
- [ ] make more use of the key $\frac {\uparrow} {above}$
- [ ] push to git more often
- [ ] complete more subjects
- [x] complete the homepage
- [x] make better use of the notes feature (Use it for large documents, not for 1 lines; that's what cards are for)
- [x] Move all the information from just cards to quotes notes (long notes with lots of detail condensed in the canvases)
- [ ] Touch up the chemistry canvas. It has not been maintained well.
