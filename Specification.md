Notation to only use markdown (and $LaTeX$ for equations). HTML is forbidden as it is time-consuming to use, not entirely cross compatible, and is insecure. 

Notes may only be used as complete (or near complete) documents embedded or quoted within a card. Notes may not be used as alternative cards with a title. 

Images linked to a caption or text card must be linked or embedded. Images that have no direct correlation to any text card may be their own card.  

Diagrams may be used to to convey information in an easy to understand manner otherwise not possible through the use of markdown or $\LaTeX$. Examples may include 'Dot and Cross' diagrams, electrical circuit diagrams and 'WxDraw2D' graphs. Diagrams may not be used for word / symbol equations or tables.  

Due to the lack of an 'alternate text' feature, maxima commands used either for complex calculations, simulations or plotting may not be saved unless it is deemed useful. Examples of useful scenario's include interactivity or data that can be safely changed by the user. In these cases, the maxima programming code will be provided with the ability to execute inside obsidian. 

Groups are to not be used in excess as they are visually noisy and consume space. Less than 3 items in a group is not recommended; 2 items in a group is forbidden. Groups used to dictate curriculum groups and sub-groups are an exception to this rule. 

Documents titled 'Table of Definitions' do not necessarily adhere to the GCSE exam board curriculum as they contain any relevant word / phrase that may need a definition.
