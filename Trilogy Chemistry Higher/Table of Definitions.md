**Atom:** The smallest unit into which [[matter]] can be divided without the release of [[ions]], usually containing an [[atomic nucleus]] consisting of [[protons]] and [[neutrons]], alongside concentric shells of [[electrons]] at different [[energy]] levels. 

**Bond:** An [[electrostatic]] attraction between [[atoms]] or [[ions]] to form [[molecules]], [[crystals]] or other [[structures]]. 

**Chemical:** 

**Charge:** 

**Chromatography:** A method of separating impure substances through the use of a travelling [[solvent]] applied upon [[chromatography paper]]. 

**Chromatography Paper:** 

**Crystal:** 

**Dissolve:** 

**Electron:** A [[sub-atomic particle]] with a negative charge, and a [[relative mass]] of < 0. 

**Electrostatic Force:** 

**Ion:** An [[electrically charged]] [[particle]], usually created as a result of a loss or gain of [[electrons]]. 

**Material:** 

**Matter:** A [[material]] [[substance]] that has [[mass]] and [[volume]] that constitutes the observable universe. 

**Mixture:** A [[material]] made of multiple [[substances]] that are not chemically [[bonded]]. 

**Molecule:** A group of multiple [[atoms]] held together [[electrostatically]]. 

**Neutron:** A [[sub-atomic particle]] with a neutral charge, and a [[relative mass]] of 1. 

**Atomic Nucleus:** 

**Proton:** A [[sub-atomic particle]] with a positive charge, and a [[relative mass]] of 1. 

**Pure substance:** A singular [[substance]] with absolutely no additions. 

**Solute:** A [[substance]] that [[dissolves]] in a [[solvent]]. 

**Solution:** A [[mixture]] containing a [[solvent]] and a [[dissolved]] [[solute]]. 

**Solvent:** A [[pure substance]] capable of [[dissolving]] one or more [[substances]], creating a [[solution]]. 

**Structure:** 

**Substance:** a [[chemical]] with a defined [[chemical]] composition.
