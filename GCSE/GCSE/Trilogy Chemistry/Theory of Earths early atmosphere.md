During the first 1.000.000.000 years:
- intense volcanic activity
- released gases to form earths early atmosphere
- similar to atmosphere of Mars and Venus
- water vapour condensed to form the oceans
- dominantly CO<sub>2</sub>
- nitrogen produced, then built up in atmosphere
- small proportions of methane + ammonia
- CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in water, carbonates precipitated
- sediments produced, reduced CO<sub>2</sub> in atmosphere
