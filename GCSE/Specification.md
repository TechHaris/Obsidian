Notation to only use markdown (and $LaTeX$ for equations). HTML is forbidden as it is time-consuming to use, not entirely cross compatible, and is insecure. 

Notes may only be used as complete (or near complete) documents embedded or quoted within a card. Notes may not be used as alternative cards with a title. 

Images linked to a caption or text card must be linked or embedded. Images that have no direct correlation to any text card may be their own card. 

Groups are to not be used in excess as they are visually noisy and consume space. Less than 3 items in a group is not recommended; 2 items in a group is forbidden. Groups used to dictate curriculum groups and sub-groups are an exception to this rule.
